# Chronic-Kidney-Disease

#Problem Statement:

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a significant health issue that requires early diagnosis to prevent severe outcomes. This study aims to apply various machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of early CKD diagnosis by analyzing relevant clinical features. The goal is to identify the most impactful features and develop predictive models that can aid in early detection, potentially improving patient outcomes.

Tools Used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix
Approach:

Data Collection:

The CKD dataset was collected and preprocessed to ensure data quality.
Data Preprocessing:

The dataset was cleaned, converted into a suitable format, and missing values were handled.
The data was then split into training and testing sets.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce dimensionality and focus on the most significant features, such as hemoglobin, albumin, and specific gravity.
Model Implementation:

Various machine learning algorithms were implemented, including ensemble methods like CatBoost, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting, as well as other classifiers like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM.
The models were trained on the CKD dataset and validated using the test data.
Evaluation:

The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
A comparison was made among the algorithms to identify the most effective model for CKD prediction.

Conclusion:

The study successfully demonstrated the application of machine learning algorithms in diagnosing Chronic Kidney Disease at an early stage. Among the models tested, CatBoost achieved the highest accuracy, making it the most effective tool for CKD prediction in this study. Ensemble methods like AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting also performed well, showing their potential in healthcare applications. The identification of key features such as hemoglobin, albumin, and specific gravity played a crucial role in enhancing the predictive accuracy of the models. This approach offers a promising direction for early intervention and improved patient care.
